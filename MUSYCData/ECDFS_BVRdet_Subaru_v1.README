This is the README to the MUSYC Subaru v1.0 Catalog generated Febuary 2010
ECDFS_BVRdet_Subaru_v1

The catalogue contains over 84402 entries with positional and flux information from 
  Sextractor and photometric redshift output from EAzY http://www.astro.yale.edu/eazy/
  (Brammer et al. 2008)

Please read the following notes on the catalog; column descriptions are listed below:
(1) The catalog includes photometry in 32 MUSYC images of the ECDF-S region (including
     UU38BVRIzJHK, 18 medium bands and 4 IRAC channels) for all sources detected in the 
     combined BVR image.   More details about the photometry can be found in 
     Cardamone et al. 2010, APJS.
(2) The first 7 columns are standard outputs (Astrometric and geometric parameters) of 
     SExstractor (http://terapix.iap.fr/IMG/pdf/sextractor.pdf)
(3) Fluxes are SExtractor aperature fluxes in units of uJy [micro-Jansky].
     In the catalog, this flux is listed in column #16, e.g. "FLUX_R".
(4) Total fluxes for each source can be computed using the ratio of the AUTO flux to 
     the APER Flux in the BVR image and the TOTCOR correction fraction computed using a 
     stellar growth curve and a total aperture based on the kron radius.  Such that
        F_TOT = F_APER * (BVR_FLUX_AUTO / F_BVR) * TOTCOR
(5) We calculate the expected Galactic extinction in each band, assuming R = 3.1 and 
     using the Galactic Extinction Curve of Cardelli et al. (1989) with updates in the 
     optical region from Oâ€™Donnell (1994).  We compute additional photometric offsets 
     for each filter using a linear combination of galaxy templates to account for small
     offsets in photometry accross our photometric bands.  See Cardamone et al. 2010 
     for more details.

    The following offsets should be applied to each filter, in order to obtain a 
    corrected total flux:
    	F_corrected=F_TOT * EXTCOR * COLCOR

(5) Objects close to bright stars or close to the border of the images, do not have 
     reliable  measured flux.  Flag Values (1-124) are reported as measured by 
     SExtractor, but flag values are offset by a value of 1000 in each band where the 
     source lies off the edge of the region covered by the imaging or where the source
     lies inside the area covered by the brightest satuarted stars.

    SExtractor flag FLAGS contain, coded in additive numbers, all the extraction flags
      as a sum of powers of 2:
        1 The object has neighbours, bright and close enough to 
          significantly bias the MAG AUTO photometry or bad 
          pixels (more than 10% of the integrated area affected),
        2 The object was originally blended with another one,
        4 At least one pixel of the object is saturated (or very close to),
        8 The object is truncated (too close to an image boundary),
        16 Object's aperture data are incomplete or corrupted,
        32 Object's isophotal data are incomplete or corrupted
        64 A memory overflow occurred during deblending,        
        128 A memory overflow occurred during extraction.
