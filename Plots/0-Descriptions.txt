1. Plotted the magnitudes from Ketron's maps vs. Candel's magnitude
   subtracted with Ketron's magnitudes. (Ketron's Magnitudes were 
   calculated from SExtractors FLUX_AUTO and then converted to mag.
   a. f125w
   b. f160w
   c. f435w
   d. f606w
   e. f775w
   f. f850l

2. Same as 1, except we first created a set of RMS maps from the
   exposure time maps. We then ran SExtractor on Ketron's maps 
   with the RMS maps for each filter.
   a. f125w
   b. f160w
   c. f435w
   d. f606w
   e. f775w
   f. f850l

3. Color-Color plots for B-drops and V-drops. The top two were created
   without using an RMS map while the bottom two were created with the
   RMS maps. We can see that much of the noise is reduced with the use
   of the RMS map.
   3a. Color-Color plot of B-drops with no RMS map.   (6564 Selections out of 13900 Sources)
   3b. Color-Color plot of V-drops with no RMS map.   ( 117 Selections out of 13900 Sources)
   3c. Color-Color plot of B-drops with RMS map.      (1772 Selections out of  5028 Sources)
   3d. Color-Color plot of V-drops with RMS map.      (  28 Selections out of  5028 Sources)

4. We looked at the color differences between our maps and Candels maps
   and then plotted the color differences against the H-band (f160w)
   magnitude. As expected, we see scattering as the magnitude increases.
   4a. My (V-I) color minus Candels (V-I) color plotted against H-band mag.
       Did not include RMS maps.
   4b. My (V-I) color minus Candels (V-I) color plotted against H-band mag.
       Did include RMS maps.
   4c. My (I-Z) color minus Candels (I-Z) color plotted against H-band mag.
       Did not include RMS maps.
   4d. My (I-Z) color minus Candels (I-Z) color plotted against H-band mag.
       Did include RMS maps.

5. We plotted the redshift distribution of the objects selected from our
   selection criteria using the catalogs generated without RMS maps.
   5a. B435 drops, expected to spike at around z~(3,4)
   5b. V606 drops, expected to spike at around z~(4,5)
   5c. I775 drops, expected to spike at around z~(5,6)

6. Same as (5), except we used the catalogs generated with RMS maps.
   6a. B435 drops, expected to spike at around z~(3,4)
   6b. V606 drops, expected to spike at around z~(4,5)
   6c. I775 drops, expected to spike at around z~(5,6)

7. We took the objects selected from the Candels catalog and matched
   those objects with the Candels photz catalog and then plotted the
   redshift distribution.
   7a. B435 drops, expected to spike at around z~(3,4)
   7b. V606 drops, expected to spike at around z~(4,5)
   7c. I775 drops, expected to spike at around z~(5,6)

8. Plotting our fluxes vs. Candels fluxes. The red line is the line y = x
   which is what our data should fit.
   8a. Using the catalog generated without the RMS map.
   8b. Using the catalog generated with the RMS map.
